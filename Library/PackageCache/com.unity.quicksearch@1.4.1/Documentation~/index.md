## Help me please

Since a lot of the functionalities of QuickSearch are available via shortcut or by using special *search tokens* you might not harness the full power of Quick Search in your first uses. Don't hesitate to type `?` in the search area to trigger the *Help Search Provider* which will help you discover more cool features about Quick search.
