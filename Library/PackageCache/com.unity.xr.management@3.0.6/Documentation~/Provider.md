## Lifecycle management

This package enables you to manage the lifecycle of XR SDK subsystems without the need for boilerplate code. The `XRManagerSettings`class provides a scriptable object that your app can use to start, stop, initialize, and deinitialize a set of subsystems defined in an `XRLoader` instance.

Providers must create a subclass of `XRLoader` to make a Loader available for their particular runtime scheme.

The `XRLoader` interface looks like this:

```csharp
public abstract class XRLoader : ScriptableObject
{
    public virtual bool Initialize() { return false; }

    public virtual bool Start() { return false; }

    public virtual bool Stop() { return false; }

    public virtual bool Deinitialize() { return false; }

    public abstract T GetLoadedSubsystem<T>() where T : IntegratedSubsystem;
}
```

To handle subsystem management in a type-safe manner, derive from the `XRLoaderHelper` class. For an example, see *[Samples/SampleLoader.cs](/Samples/SampleLoader.cs)*.

An `XRLoader` is a [ScriptableObject](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/class-ScriptableObject.html), which means you can create one or more instances of it. Each `XRLoader` subclass defines the subsystems and their load order, and manages the set of subsystems they require.

Add all the `XRLoader` instances you created to the **Loaders** property of the **XRManagerSettings**, and arrange them in the order you want them to load. When initializing Loaders, **XR Manager Settings** calls each `XRLoader` instance it has a reference to, in the order you specify, and attempts to initialize each one. The first Loader to initialize successfully becomes the active Loader and Unity stops all further attempts to initialize other Loaders. Once that happens, you can query the static `XRManagerSettings.ActiveLoader` instance to access the active Loader. If all Loaders fail to initialize, Unity sets `activeLoader` to null.

Scene-based automatic lifecycle management hooks into the following `MonoBehaviour` callback points:

|Callback|Lifecycle step|
|---|---|
|OnEnable|Find the first Loader that initialized successfully and set `ActiveLoader`.|
|Start|Start all subsystems.|
|OnDisable|Stop all subsystems.|
|OnDestroy|Deinitialize all subsystems and remove the `ActiveLoader` instance.|

Application lifetime-based automatic lifecycle management hooks into the following callback points:

|Callback|Lifecycle step|
|---|---|
|Runtime initialization after assemblies loaded|Find the first Loader that succeeds initialization and set `ActiveLoader`.|
|Runtime initialization before splash screen displays|Start all subsystems.|
|OnDisable|Stop all subsystems.|
|OnDestroy|Deintialize all subsystems and remove the `ActiveLoader` instance.|

## Configuring build and runtime settings through Unified Settings

A provider might need additional settings to help manage build issues or runtime configuration. To do this, add an `XRConfigurationData` attribute to a ScriptableObject, and define a set of properties you want to surface to allow users to control configuration. Unity displays configuration options in the **XR** section of the **Unified Settings** window.

Unity manages the lifecycle of one instance of the class marked with the attribute through the [EditorBuildSettings](https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/EditorBuildSettings.html) config object API. If you don't provide a dedicated UI, configuration settings are displayed in the **Unified Settings** window using the standard **Scriptable Object** UI Inspector. You can create a custom **Editor** for your configuration settings type, which then replaces the standard Inspector in the **Unified Settings** window.

The provider needs to handle getting the settings from `EditorUserBuildSettings` into the built application. You can do this with a custom build processing script. If you only need to make sure that you have access to the same settings at runtime, you can derive from `XRBuildHelper<T>`. This is a generic abstract base class that takes the build settings stored in `EditorUserBuildSettings` and gets them into the built application for runtime access.

The simplest build script for your package would look like this:

```csharp
public class MyBuildProcessor : XRBuildHelper<MySettings> 
{
    public override string BuildSettingsKey { get { return "MyPackageSettingsKey"; } }
}
```

You can override the build processing steps from `IPreprocessBuildWithReport` and `IPostprocessBuildWithReport`, but make sure you call to the base class implementation. If you donâ€™t, your settings don't transfer to the built application.

```csharp
public class MyBuildProcessor : XRBuildHelper<MySettings> 
{ 
    public override string BuildSettingsKey { get { return "MyPackageSettingsKey"; } }

    public override void OnPreprocessBuild(BuildReport report)
    {
        base.OnPreprocessBuild(report);
        // Do your work here
    }

    public override void OnPostprocessBuild(BuildReport report)
    {
        base.OnPreprocessBuild(report);
        // Do your work here
    }
}
```

If you want to support different settings per platform at build time, you can override `UnityEngine.Object SettingsForBuildTargetGroup(BuildTargetGroup buildTargetGroup)` and use the `buildTargetGroup` attribute to retrieve the appropriate platform settings. By default, this method uses the key associated with the settings instance to copy the entire settings object from `EditorUserBuildSettings` to `PlayerSettings`.

```csharp
public class MyBuildProcessor : XRBuildHelper<MySettings> 
{ 
    public override string BuildSettingsKey { get { return "MyPackageSettingsKey"; } }

    public override UnityEngine.Object SettingsForBuildTargetGroup(BuildTargetGroup buildTargetGroup)
    {
        // Get platform specific settings and return them. Use something like the following
        // for simple settings data that isn't platform specific.
        UnityEngine.Object settingsObj = null;
        EditorBuildSettings.TryGetConfigObject(BuildSettingsKey, out settingsObj);
        if (settingsObj == null || !(settingsObj is T))
            return null;

        return settingsObj;

    }
}
```

If you need more extensive support and/or complete control, you can make a copy of the `SampleBuildProcessor` in the `Samples/Editor` folder and work from there.

## Package initialization

Because ScriptableObject instances must support Loaders and settings, you must create these instances at some point. The quickest way to do this is to create them when you install the XR Plugin Management package. Otherwise, both **XRManagerSettings** and **Unified Settings** support creating them on-demand.

If you derive a class from `XRPackageInitializationBase` and fill out the interface properties and methods, the system uses these to create default instances of your Loader and settings during installation, and places these instances in their respective default locations (`Assets/XR/Loaders` for Loaders, `Assets/XR/Settings` for settings). You can relocate these anywhere within your Project, as long as Unity can locate at least one instance of each type for each package.

## Installing the XR Plugin Management package

Most XR SDK Provider packages typically include XR Plugin Management, so you shouldn't need to install it. If you do need to install it, follow the instructions in the [Package Manager documentation](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.package-manager-ui@latest/index.html).
