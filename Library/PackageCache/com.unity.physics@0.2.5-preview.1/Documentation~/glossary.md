| Term | Description |
|--|---|
| Center of mass (COM) | Forces applied to the [center of mass](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Center_of_mass) will push the body in the direction of the force without causing rotation.
| Compound Collider | A compound collider is a set of Physics Shapes nested under a single Physics Body. The shapes behave as a single body. |
| Convex Radius (Bevel Radius) | To improve the performance and robustness of collision detection Unity Physics allows contacts to be generated within a small tolerance of the surface of a convex shape. This tolerance is referred to as convex radius or bevel radius. |
| Convex shape | A convex shape or volume has the property that a line segment drawn between any two points inside the volume never leaves the volume. Unity Physics exploits this property to accelerate the performance of collision detection and spatial queries. |
| Degree of Freedom (DOF) | A description of how a linear system is free to move. In rigid body dynamics this usually refers to the 6 degrees of freedom a body has when moving in free space. These are 3 linear and 3 angular degrees of freedom. They correspond to the axes you specify when describing a constraint. |
| Inertia Tensor | Describes the mass distribution of a rigid body. In particular it affects how the angular velocity of a body can change. See [Moment of inertia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moment_of_inertia). |
| Jacobian | Typically describes a constraint used during constraint solving. See [Jacobian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacobian_matrix_and_determinant). |
