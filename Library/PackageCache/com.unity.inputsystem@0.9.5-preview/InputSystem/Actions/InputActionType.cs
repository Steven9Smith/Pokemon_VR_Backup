    /// but simply triggers the action on every value change.

        /// After being started, the action will perform on every value change that is not the default value. In the example here, if
        /// the stick goes to (0.75,0.75) and then to (1,1), the action will perform twice.

        /// Finally, if the control value changes back to the default value, the action is canceled (<see cref="InputActionPhase.Canceled"/>).

        /// <remarks>
        /// This is in some ways similar to <see cref="Value"/>. However, there are two key differences.
        ///
        /// For one,  the action will not perform any disambiguation when bound to multiple controls concurrently.
        /// This means that if, for example, the action is bound to both the left and the right stick on a <see cref="Gamepad"/>,
        /// and the left stick goes to (0.5,0.5) and the right stick then goes to (0.25,0.25), the action will perform
        /// twice yielding a value of (0.5,0.5) first and a value of (0.25, 0.25) next. This is different from <see cref="Value"/>
        /// where upon actuation to (0.5,0.5), the left stick would get to drive the action and the actuation of the right
        /// stick would be ignored as it does not exceed the magnitude of the actuation on the left stick.
        ///
        /// The second key difference is that only <see cref="InputActionPhase.Performed"/> is used and will get triggered
        /// on every value change regardless of what the value is. This is different from <see cref="Value"/> where the
        /// action will trigger <see cref="InputActionPhase.Started"/> when moving away from its default value and will
        /// trigger <see cref="InputActionPhase.Canceled"/> when going back to the default value.
