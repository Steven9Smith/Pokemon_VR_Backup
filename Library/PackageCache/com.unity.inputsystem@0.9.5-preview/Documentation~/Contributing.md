# Contributing

[Full source code](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/InputSystem) for the input system is available on GitHub. This is also where most of our development happens.

>NOTE: This includes the full source code for the managed/C# part of the system. At this point, the native, platform-specific C++ backends are still closed-source and require a source code license.

## Reporting Bugs

Input System bugs should be reported through using [same mechanism as for any other Unity bugs](https://unity3d.com/unity/qa/bug-reporting). Make sure to submit a repro project, and to mention that the bug is specific to the Input System package in the description, so it can get forwarded to the correct respondents at Unity.

## Discussion

To ask questions or discuss the input system, we have a [dedicated section on Unity's forum](https://forum.unity.com/forums/new-input-system.103/). This is also the best place to post feature requests.
