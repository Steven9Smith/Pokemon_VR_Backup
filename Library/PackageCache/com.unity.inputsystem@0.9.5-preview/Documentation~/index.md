# Input System

>NOTE: The input system package is still under development and this manual is a work-in-progress. There is still outdated and missing information.

The Input System package implements a system to use any kind of input device to control your Unity content. This is intended to be a more powerful, flexible and configurable replacement for Unity's classic Input Manager (the `UnityEngine.Input` class).

To get started, check the [Installation](Installation.md) and [Quick Start Guide](QuickStartGuide.md) sections.
